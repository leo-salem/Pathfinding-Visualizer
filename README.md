# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview

This project is a graphical application that demonstrates popular pathfinding algorithms such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The application is built using Java and JavaFX for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Visualize how BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm find paths.
- Randomly generated weighted grids.
- User interaction to set start, end, and wall cells.

## Tools and Technologies

### Programming Language

- Java

### GUI Framework

- JavaFX

### Components

- JavaFX Canvas for grid drawing.
- JavaFX Buttons and Labels for user interaction.

### Concurrency

- JavaFX Task and Threads for algorithm visualization without freezing the UI.

### Data Structures

- Java Collections (Queue, Map, PriorityQueue, etc.).

## Prerequisites

1. **Install JDK**:

   - Download and install the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
   - Set up the system `PATH` variable to include the JDK's `bin` directory.

2. **Install JavaFX**:

   - Download the JavaFX SDK from [here](https://openjfx.io/).
   - Set the JavaFX library path in your IDE or build tool (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leo-salem/Pathfinding-Visualizer.git
   cd pathfinding-visualizer
   ```

2. Compile and run the project:

   - In your IDE, configure the JavaFX library.
   - Run the `pathfinding` class (contains the `main` method).

3. Interact with the UI:

   - Set start and end cells by clicking the corresponding buttons and then clicking on the grid.
   - Add wall cells by enabling the wall tool and clicking grid cells.
   - Run any of the algorithms (BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra) to visualize the pathfinding process.
